abstract = {An assignment problem is considered with the constraint that the same hypothesis cannot be applied to more than one object. We desire efficiency without approximation. Multiple target tracking methods such as the joint probabilistic association filter (JPDAF) motivate us. Methods of solving this assignment problem involving enumerating all possible joint assignments is infeasible except for small problems. A recent approach circumvents this combinatorial explosion by representing the structure of the target hypotheses in a `net' which exploits redundancy in an ordered list of objects us to describe the problem. Here, we generalize this approach to process the objects in a tree structure this exploits conditional independence between subsets of the objects. This gives a substantial computational saving and allows us to consider scenarios which were previously impractical. In particular, we show the feasibility of using an exact JPDAF implementation to track 400 targets},

abstract = {Track-to-track fusion is an important part in distributed multisensor-multitarget tracking. The centralized and distributed tracking configurations were studied in (H.Chen et al., Proc. of SPIE Conf. on Signal and Data Processing of Small Targets, vol. 4048, 2000) using simulated air-to-air scenarios, and in (K.C.

The current work generalizes the results in the latter to the cases with more than 2 sensors. As the number of sensors increases, the performance of the distributed tracker is shown to degrade compared with the centralized estimation even when the optimal track-to-track fusion is used. An approximate track-to-track fusion is presented and compared with the optimal track-to-track fusion with performance curves for various numbers of sensors. These performance curves can be used in designing a fusion system where certain trade-offs need to be considered. Finally, these results are compared with simulation results for a realistic air-to-air encounter scenario.},

abstract = {This paper discusses several theoretical issues related to the score function for the measurement-to-track association/assignment decision in the track-oriented version of the multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT). This score function is the likelihood ratio: the ratio of the probability density function (pdf) of a measurement having originated from a track, to the pdf of this measurement having a different origin. The likelihood ratio score is derived rigorously starting from the fully Bayesian MHT (hypothesis oriented, based on combinatorial analysis of the general multitarget problem), which is shown to be amenable under some (reasonable) assumptions to the track-oriented MHT (TOMHT). The latter can be implemented efficiently using multidimensional assignment (MDA). The main feature of a likelihood ratio is the fact that it is a (physically) dimensionless quantity and, consequently, can be used for the association of different numbers of measurements and/or measurements of different dimension. The explicit forms of the likelihood ratio are discussed both for the commonly used Kalman tracking filter, as well as for the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator. The issues of measurements of different dimension and different coordinate systems together with the selection of certain MHT design parameters - the spatial densities of the false measurements and new targets - are also discussed},

abstract = {In maritime surveillance, messages from radar and the Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers are used for vessel trafficking and monitoring. The common trend is to use radars as the primary source of surveillance and AIS as a secondary source with little interaction between these data sets. The AIS messages provide very accurate position estimates associated with ID and other vessel information. However, AIS messages arrive unpredictably and intermittently depending on the type and behavior of the vessel. In addition, the revisit interval of AIS messages could be very large and it may vary from one vessel to another. In this work, a new measurement-level fusion algorithm to combine radar and AIS messages is proposed using the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) framework. The proposed method handles AIS ID swaps between vessels and missing IDs while effectively fusing the radar measurements with AIS messages at measurement level. The uncertainty in the AIS ID-to-track assignment is resolved by assigning multiple AIS IDs to a target and updating the ID probabilities using a Bayesian inference with radar measurements, AIS messages and other targets. The performance of the proposed measurement-level fusion is compared with that of the track-to-track fusion. A modified Posterior Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB) is also derived for the variable-rate heterogenous AIS/Radar network. Experimental results based on simulated data demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique.},

abstract = {The capability of following amoving target in an environment with obstacles is required as a basic and neces- sary function for realizing an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Many target following scenarios involve a follower and target vehicles that may have different maneu- vering capabilities. Moreover, the follower vehicle may not have prior information about the intended motion of the target boat. This paper presents a trajectory planning and tracking approach for following a differentially constrained target vehicle operating in an obstacle field. The developed approach includes a novel algorithm for computing a desired pose and surge speed in the vicinity of the target boat, jointly defined as a motion goal, and tightly integrates it with tra- jectory planning and tracking components of the entire sys- tem. The trajectory planner generates a dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectory to allow the USV to safely reach the computed motion goal. Trajectory planning needs to be suf- ficiently fast and yet produce dynamically feasible and short trajectories due to the moving target. This required speed- ing up the planning by searching for trajectories through a hybrid, pose-position state space using a multi-resolution control action set. The search in the velocity space is decou- pled from the search for a trajectory in the pose space. There- fore, the underlying trajectory tracking controller computes desired surge speed for each segment of the trajectory and ensures that the USV maintains it.We have carried out sim- ulation as well as experimental studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.},

For applications in which this filter is appropriate, it is likely to be tractable for only a small number of targets. In earlier papers we derived closed-form equations for an approximation of this filter based on propagation of a first-order multitarget moment called the probability hypothesis density (PHD). In a recent paper, Erdinc, Willett, and Bar-Shalom argued for the need for a PHD-type filter which remains first-order in the states of individual targets, but which is higher-order in target number. In this paper we show that this is indeed possible. We derive a closed-form cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter, which propagates not only the PHD but also the entire probability distribution on target number.},

abstract = {Majority (80 to 85{\%}) of all recorded maritime accidents are generally attributed to human error or associated with human error. Contribution of human error to maritime accidents has increased over a ten-year period 1991 to 2001 (Baker and Seah, 2004). Most of the accidents are the result of senseless and avoidable human errors. The concern about human factors is growing as human error is significantly implicated in so many marine accidents. Pomeroy and Tomlinson (2000) stated that many of the failures are actually the result of errors (i.e. latent failures) that have been designed and constructed into highly complex systems especially system integration and interfacing. The scale of damage suffered, taken together with the implication of human error as a major cause for the accidents, has made human factors study an important area of concern globally. Many individuals and organisations are involved in marine navigation risk management framework. The main focus is to enhance safety of mariner's performance through motivation, education and training, system design, and procedures and rules. Figure 1 is a systematic risk management framework adapted from Rasmussen (1997, 2000). The behaviours associated with the navigation process are at the lowest level and the international organisations responsible for setting laws, at the highest level. The way in which decisions of top levels influence activities of lower levels, and the feedback from lower levels to top levels, will be very important determinants of safety in marine navigation. In addition, some external dynamic forces will put pressures on the system and change the structure of the system over time (Rasmussen, 1997, 2000).},

abstract = {An algorithm for tracking multiple targets in a cluttered enviroment is developed. The algorithm is capable of initiating tracks, accounting for false or missing reports, and processing sets of dependent reports. As each measurement is received, probabilities are calculated for the hypotheses that the measurement came from previously known targets in a target file, or from a new target, or that the measurement is false. Target states are estimated from each such data-association hypothesis using a Kalman filter. As more measurements are received, the probabilities of joint hypotheses are calculated recursively using all available information such as density of unknown targets, density of false targets, probability of detection, and location uncertainty. This branching technique allows correlation of a measurement with its source based on subsequent, as well as previous, data. To keep the number of hypotheses reasonable, unlikely hypotheses are eliminated and hypotheses with similar target estimates are combined. To minimize computational requirements, the entire set of targets and measurements is divided into clusters that are solved independently. In an illustrative example of aircraft tracking, the algorithm successfully tracks targets over a wide range of conditions.},

abstract = {For the problem of tracking multiple targets, the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) approach has shown to be very effective in handling clutter and missed detections. The JPDA, however, tends to coalesce neighboring tracks and ignores the coupling between those tracks. Fitzgerald [6] has shown that hypothesis pruning may be an effective way to prevent track coalescence. Unfortunately, this process leads to an undesired sensitivity to clutter and missed detections, and it does not support any coupling. To improve this situation, the paper follows a novel approach to combine the advantages of JPDA, coupling, and hypothesis pruning into new algorithms. First, the problem of multiple target tracking is embedded into one filtering for a linear descriptor system with stochastic coefficients. Next, for this descriptor system, the exact Bayesian and new JPDA filters are derived. Finally, through Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that these new PDA filters are able to handle coupling and insensitive to track coalescence, clutter, and missed detections.},

@article{Blackman2004,
abstract = {Multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) is generally accepted as the preferred method for solving the data association problem in modern multiple target tracking (MTT) systems. This paper summarizes the motivations for MHT, the basic principles behind MHT and the alternative implementations in common use. It discusses the manner in which the multiple data association hypotheses formed by MHT can be combined with multiple filter models, such as used by the interacting multiple model (IMM) method. An overview of the studies that show the advantages of MHT over the conventional single hypothesis approach is given. Important current applications and areas of future research and development for MHT are discussed.},

@article{Singer1974,
abstract = {When tracking targets in dense environments, sensor reports originating from sources other than the target being tracked (i.e., from clutter, thermal false alarms, other targets) are occasionally incorrectly used in track updating. As a result tracking performance degrades, and the error covariance matrix calculated on-line by the usual types of tracking filters becomes extremely unreliable for estimating actual accuracies. This paper makes three contributions in this area. First, a new tracking filter is developed that incorporates, in an a posteriori statistical fashion, all data available from sensor reports located in the vicinity of the track, and that provides both optimal performance and reliable estimates of this performance when operating in dense environments. The optimality of and the performance equations for this filter are verified by analytical and simulation results. Second, several computationally efficient classes of suboptimal tracking filters based on the optimal filter developed in this paper and on an optimal filter of another class that appeared previously in the literature are developed. Third, using an extensive Monte Carlo simulation, the various optimal and suboptimal filters as well as the Kalman filter are compared, with regard to the differences between the on-line calculated and experimental covariances of each filter, and with regard to relative accuracies, computational requirements, and numbers of divergences or lost tracks each produces.},

However, the actual practical implementation of MHT has been impeded by the perception that its complexity precludes real-time application. The purpose of this paper is to show that modem computational capabilities and newly developed MHT algorithm efficiencies make real-time MHT implementation feasible even for scenarios with large numbers of closely spaced targets.},
