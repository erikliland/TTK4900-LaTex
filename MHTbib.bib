@article{Reid1979,
abstract = {An algorithm for tracking multiple targets in a cluttered enviroment is developed. The algorithm is capable of initiating tracks, accounting for false or missing reports, and processing sets of dependent reports. As each measurement is received, probabilities are calculated for the hypotheses that the measurement came from previously known targets in a target file, or from a new target, or that the measurement is false. Target states are estimated from each such data-association hypothesis using a Kalman filter. As more measurements are received, the probabilities of joint hypotheses are calculated recursively using all available information such as density of unknown targets, density of false targets, probability of detection, and location uncertainty. This branching technique allows correlation of a measurement with its source based on subsequent, as well as previous, data. To keep the number of hypotheses reasonable, unlikely hypotheses are eliminated and hypotheses with similar target estimates are combined. To minimize computational requirements, the entire set of targets and measurements is divided into clusters that are solved independently. In an illustrative example of aircraft tracking, the algorithm successfully tracks targets over a wide range of conditions.},

@article{Storms2003,
abstract = {In this work we present a linear programming (LP) based approach for solving the data association problem (DAP) in multiple target tracking. It is well-known that the DAP can be formulated as an integer program. We present a compact formulation of the DAP. To solve practical instances of the DAP we propose an algorithm that uses an iterated K-scan sliding window technique. In each iteration we solve the LP relaxation of an integer program and next apply a greedy rounding procedure. Computational experiments indicate that the quality of the solutions found is quite satisfactory. The purpose of this article is to present an alternative approach to solving data association problems that arise from multitarget tracking. As a starting point we use the work reported by Poore et al. (Comput. Optim. Appl. 3 (1994) 27; SPIE 1954 (1993) 552) in which the data association problem is viewed as a multidimensional assignment problem. Instead of using Lagrangian relaxation techniques (SIAM J. Optim. 3 (1993) 554; SPIE 1955 (1993) 172; SPIE 1954 (1993) 564; SPIE 2561 (1995) 448), we apply linear programming (LP) relaxation. A feasible solution is constructed from the relaxed solution by a new heuristic greedy rounding procedure called GRP. The choice for a heuristic approach is justified by the hard real-time requirements that are inherent to multitarget tracking. The application of the GRP lies mainly within the field of (air) surveillance systems for both the military and the civilian domain. Although the focus of this paper is on single sensor systems (i.e. a surveillance radar), the scope can be extended to sensor data fusion systems in which multiple (dissimilar) sensors are involved. More generally, real-time algorithms that provide good-quality solutions for multidimensional assignment problems have a broad scope of applications in the field of robotics (e.g. planning of robot arm movement), communications and the military domain (e.g. weapon assignment, sensor resource allocation, etc.). ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {When tracking targets in dense environments, sensor reports originating from sources other than the target being tracked (i.e., from clutter, thermal false alarms, other targets) are occasionally incorrectly used in track updating. As a result tracking performance degrades, and the error covariance matrix calculated on-line by the usual types of tracking filters becomes extremely unreliable for estimating actual accuracies. This paper makes three contributions in this area. First, a new tracking filter is developed that incorporates, in an a posteriori statistical fashion, all data available from sensor reports located in the vicinity of the track, and that provides both optimal performance and reliable estimates of this performance when operating in dense environments. The optimality of and the performance equations for this filter are verified by analytical and simulation results. Second, several computationally efficient classes of suboptimal tracking filters based on the optimal filter developed in this paper and on an optimal filter of another class that appeared previously in the literature are developed. Third, using an extensive Monte Carlo simulation, the various optimal and suboptimal filters as well as the Kalman filter are compared, with regard to the differences between the on-line calculated and experimental covariances of each filter, and with regard to relative accuracies, computational requirements, and numbers of divergences or lost tracks each produces.},

@article{Bar-Shalom2007,
abstract = {This paper discusses several theoretical issues related to the score function for the measurement-to-track association/assignment decision in the track-oriented version of the multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT). This score function is the likelihood ratio: the ratio of the probability density function (pdf) of a measurement having originated from a track, to the pdf of this measurement having a different origin. The likelihood ratio score is derived rigorously starting from the fully Bayesian MHT (hypothesis oriented, based on combinatorial analysis of the general multitarget problem), which is shown to be amenable under some (reasonable) assumptions to the track-oriented MHT (TOMHT). The latter can be implemented efficiently using multidimensional assignment (MDA). The main feature of a likelihood ratio is the fact that it is a (physically) dimensionless quantity and, consequently, can be used for the association of different numbers of measurements and/or measurements of different dimension. The explicit forms of the likelihood ratio are discussed both for the commonly used Kalman tracking filter, as well as for the interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator. The issues of measurements of different dimension and different coordinate systems together with the selection of certain MHT design parameters - the spatial densities of the false measurements and new targets - are also discussed},

abstract = {For the problem of tracking multiple targets, the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) approach has shown to be very effective in handling clutter and missed detections. The JPDA, however, tends to coalesce neighboring tracks and ignores the coupling between those tracks. Fitzgerald [6] has shown that hypothesis pruning may be an effective way to prevent track coalescence. Unfortunately, this process leads to an undesired sensitivity to clutter and missed detections, and it does not support any coupling. To improve this situation, the paper follows a novel approach to combine the advantages of JPDA, coupling, and hypothesis pruning into new algorithms. First, the problem of multiple target tracking is embedded into one filtering for a linear descriptor system with stochastic coefficients. Next, for this descriptor system, the exact Bayesian and new JPDA filters are derived. Finally, through Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that these new PDA filters are able to handle coupling and insensitive to track coalescence, clutter, and missed detections.},

Multiple target tracking methods such as the joint probabilistic association filter (JPDAF) motivate us. Methods of solving this assignment problem involving enumerating all possible joint assignments is infeasible except for small problems. A recent approach circumvents this combinatorial explosion by representing the structure of the target hypotheses in a `net' which exploits redundancy in an ordered list of objects us to describe the problem. Here, we generalize this approach to process the objects in a tree structure this exploits conditional independence between subsets of the objects. This gives a substantial computational saving and allows us to consider scenarios which were previously impractical. In particular, we show the feasibility of using an exact JPDAF implementation to track 400 targets},

The probabilistic data association (PDA) method, which is based on computing the posterior probability of each candidate measurement found in a validation gate, assumes that only one real target is present and all other measurements are Poisson-distributed clutter. In this paper, a new theoretical result is presented: the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm, in which joint posterior association probabilities are computed for multiple targets (or multiple discrete interfering sources) in Poisson clutter. The algorithm is applied to a passive sonar tracking problem with multiple sensors and targets, in which a target is not fully observable from a single sensor. Targets are modeled with four geographic states, two or more acoustic states, and realistic (i.e., low) probabilities of detection at each sample time. A simulation result is presented for two heavily interfering targets illustrating the dramatic tracking improvements obtained by estimating the targets' states using joint association probabilities.},
