To enable autonomous sea vessels' safe voyage, a real time situational awareness system is required. A tracking system incorporating both radar and \gls{ais} sensor data is preferred in maritime situations since radar and \gls{ais} have different strong and weak properties. In this thesis, a multi-sensor multi-frame multitarget tracking system based on radar and \gls{ais} \glspl{measurement} from own vessel is developed. The system consist of a two main parts, a logic based initialization algorithm and a \gls{tomht}. This tracking system is demonstrated on simulated multitarget data with different tuning settings, external environment and AIS configurations.

The track loss was improved from X\% to X\% when comparing only radar measurements with all targets equipped with class A \gls{ais} and to X\% with class B \gls{ais}.
