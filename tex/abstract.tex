To enable autonomous sea vessel's safe voyage, a real time situational awareness system is required. A tracking system incorporating both radar and \gls{ais} sensor data is preferred in maritime situations since radar and \gls{ais} have different strong and weak properties. A multi-frame multitarget tracking system based on radar \glspl{measurement} from own vessel, aided by \gls{ais} messages is developed. The system consist of two main parts, a logic based initialization algorithm and a \gls{tomht}, both utilizing radar and \gls{ais}. This tracking system is demonstrated on simulated multitarget data with different tuning settings, external environment and AIS configurations.

The track loss improvement for window sizes of 3--9 of all targets equipped with class A \gls{ais} in a cluttered environment with low \gls{Pd} (50\%) was 85--94\%. The tracking time percentage was improved by 43\% for small (N=3) multi-frame window sizes and 8--15\% for larger (N=6--9) window sizes when comparing pure radar measurements with full class A \gls{ais} coverage for very low detection probability (50\%) and high clutter density.
