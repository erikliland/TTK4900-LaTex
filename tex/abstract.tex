To enable autonomous sea vessel's safe voyage, a real time situational awareness system is required. A tracking system incorporating both radar and \gls{ais} sensor data is preferred in maritime situations since radar and \gls{ais} have different strong and weak properties. A multi-sensor multi-frame multitarget tracking system based on radar and \gls{ais} \glspl{measurement} from on vessel sensors is developed. The system consist of a two main parts, a logic based initialization algorithm and a \gls{tomht}. This tracking system is demonstrated on simulated multitarget data with different tuning settings, external environment and AIS configurations.

The track loss was improved from X\% to X\% when comparing pure radar measurements with full class A \gls{ais} coverage and to X\% with class B \gls{ais}.
