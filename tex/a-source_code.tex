\chapter{Source code}
pyMHT, the Python3 implementation of the MHT module developed in this thesis can be found at GitHub: \url{https://github.com/erikliland/pyMHT}.

Except for packages available via PyPI the only requirements is the Google Optimization Tools (OR-Tools) which can be obtained from \url{https://developers.google.com/optimization/}, and Jacob Frelinger's Cython / C++ implementation of the Munkres algorithm \url{https://github.com/jfrelinger/cython-munkres-wrapper}. The later is installed automatically with the pyMHT package.
