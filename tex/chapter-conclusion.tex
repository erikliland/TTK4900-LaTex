\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}
To the knowledge of the author, this thesis has presented the first \gls{mht} implementation utilizing both \gls{ais} and \gls{radar} information. It has shown the benefits of using \gls{ais} to aid an \gls{ilp} based track oriented \gls{mht} integrated into a complete tracking system. The behaviour and performance for different tuning parameter in a logic based track initiator has also been demonstrated.
Through simulations it has been shown that targets with low probability of detection benefits greatly from \gls{ais} aiding, whereas targets with moderate to high probability of detection gained less benefits.
