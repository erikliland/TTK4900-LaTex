\section{Tracking}

\subsection{Singletarget Tracking}
Tracking, in this context, is to follow stationary and moving targets that are observed by a system without included association data. The problem is to know which measurements belong together over time, often reffered to as the data association problem.

\subsection{Multitarget tracking}
A subset of tracking is multitarget tracking, where the problem expands to jointly estimate both the number of targets and their trajectories. While a large number of tracking technicues have been developed, the three most used are \gls{jpdaf}, \gls{mht} and \gls{rfs}~\cite{Vo2015}.

%JPDAF
\gls{jpdaf} is a multitarget expansion of \gls{pdaf} which is a singletarget tracking technique. The essense of them both is consider
