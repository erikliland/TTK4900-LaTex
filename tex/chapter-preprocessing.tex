\section{Radar preprocessing}


\section{AIS preprocessing}~\label{sec:ais_preprocessing}
All \gls{ais} measurements are buffered from when they are received to the next radar scan. This is a design choice, which in some sense synchronize the AIS to the radar. Since the radar period is much smaller than (or in the best case for the AIS, equal to) the AIS transmit period, this will seldom lead to unused AIS measurements. On the other hand, since the radar period is relative short, the amount of time any AIS position will be predicted forward is typically small enough to not cause uncertainty larger than manageable for the algorithm. 

As will be obvious in Section~\ref{subsec:combined_radar_and_ais_hypotheses}, this prediction is only used for the gating sequence.
