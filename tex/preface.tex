This Master thesis is written at \gls{ntnu} as final work in the Engineering Cybernetics study program with specialisation in Robotics and Vessel control and was carried out during the spring of 2017.

I would like to thank the people that have made this thesis a reality. First of all, my supervisor associate professor Edmund F. Brekke for giving me freedom and trust to seek out my own solution and guidance with constructive feedback. Next, a great thanks to my co-supervisors Ph.D. students Erik F. Wilthil and Andreas L. Fl√•ten for helpful discussion and giving me access to our computing server `Syn'. I would also thank Paal Kristian for a beeing a great companion at the office.
