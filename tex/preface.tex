This Master thesis is written at \gls{ntnu} as final work in the Engineering Cybernetics study program with specialisation in Robotics and Vessel control and was carried out during the spring of 2017.

I would like to thank the people that have made this thesis a reality. First of all, my supervisor Associate Professor Edmund F. Brekke for giving me freedom and trust to seek out my own solutions, and give guidance with constructive feedback. Next, a great thanks to my Co-Supervisors Ph.D. students Erik F. Wilthil and Andreas L. Fl√•ten for helpful discussions and for giving me access to our computing server `Syn'. I would also thank Paal Kristian for being a great companion at the office.

This thesis would not have been completed without the patience and understanding from my girlfriend Elisabeth, thank you.
